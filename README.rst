Sphinx-github-changelog is a Sphinx_ plugin that builds a changelog section based on
a repository's `GitHub Releases`_ content.

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
.. _`GitHub Releases`: https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases

How ? (the short version)
=========================

In your Sphinx documentation ``conf.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    extensions = [
        ...,  # your other extensions
        "sphinx_github_changelog",
    ]

In your documentation:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. changelog::
        :changelog-url: https://your-project.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#changelog
        :github: https://github.com/you/your-project/releases/
        :pypi: https://pypi.org/project/your-project/

or more minimally (but not necessarily recommended):

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. changelog::


See the end result for this project on ReadTheDocs__.

Why ?
=====

On the way to continuous delivery, it's important to be able to release easily.
One of the criteria for easy releases is that the release doesn't require a commit and
a Pull Request. Release Pull Requests usually include 2 parts:

- Changing the version
- Updating the changelog (if you keep a changelog, let's assume you do)

Commitless releases need a way to store the version and the changelog, as close as
possible to the code, but actually **not in** the code.

Setting aside the "version" question, ``sphinx-github-changelog`` aims at providing
a good way of managing the "changelog" part:

The best solution we've found so far for the changelog is to store it in the body of
`GitHub Releases`_. That's very practical for maintainers, but it may not be the first
place people will look for it. As far as we've seen, people expect the changelog to
be:

- in the repo, in ``CHANGELOG.rst``,
- in the documentation.

Having the changelog in ``CHANGELOG.rst`` causes a few problems:

- Either each PR adds its single line of changelog, but:

  - you'll most probably run into countless merge conflicts,
  - the changelog won't tell you which contribution was part of which release

  This reduces the interest for the whole thing.

- Or your changelog is edited at release time. Maybe you're using towncrier_ for
  fragment-based changelog, but you're not doing commitless releases anymore. You could
  imagine that the release commit is done by your CI, but this can quickly become
  annoying, especially if you require Pull Requests.

But there is another way. Instead of providing the changelog, the ``CHANGELOG.rst``
file can hold a *link* to the changelog. This makes things much easier.
``sphinx-github-changelog`` encourages you to do that.

A complete toolbelt
-------------------

Alongside ``sphinx-github-changelog``, we suggest a few tools that play nice together:

- `setuptools-scm`_ will compute your version in ``setup.py`` based on git tags.
- `release-drafter`_ will keep a "Draft release" updated as you merge Pull Requests to
  your repository, so you just have to slightly adjust the release body, and create a
  tag.
- Any Continuous Integration solution should be able to listen to new tags, and build
  and upload distributions to PyPI. Don't forget to use `PyPI API tokens`_!
- And ReadTheDocs_ to host your built documentation, of course.

.. _`setuptools-scm`: https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/
.. _`release-drafter`: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases
.. _towncrier: https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/
.. _`PyPI API tokens`: https://pypi.org/help/#token
.. _ReadTheDocs: https://readthedocs.org/

If you're using all the tools above, then releasing is simple as proof-reading the
draft GitHub Release and press "Publish Release". That's it.

Reference documentation
=======================

Automatic Configuration
-----------------------

The extension can automatically detect the GitHub repository URL from your
git remotes in this order:

1. ``upstream`` remote
2. ``origin`` remote

The GraphQL API and GitHub root URL are derived from this URL.

If for any reason, you'd rather provide the repository explicitly (e.g. the doc
repo doesn't match the repo you're releasing from, or anything else), you can
define the ``:github:`` attribute to the directive. See directive_ for
details.


Authentication
--------------

The extension uses the GitHub GraphQL API to retrieve the changelog. This
requires authentication using a GitHub API token.

However if you use git over HTTPS, or the ``gh`` CLI, you probably already have a
suitable token, which ``sphinx-github-changelog`` will automatically use.

In CI like GitHub Actions you can pass a token explicitly as an environment
variable:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: Build documentation
      run: make html
      env:
        SPHINX_GITHUB_CHANGELOG_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}

In remaining cases you may need to create a personal access token. If the
repository is public, the token doesn't need any special access (you can
uncheck eveything). For private and internal repositories, the token must
have ``repo`` scope (classic tokens) or ``contents: read`` access (fine-grained
tokens).

Pass the token as the ``SPHINX_GITHUB_CHANGELOG_TOKEN`` environment variable.
You can also set the token as ``sphinx_github_changelog_token`` in ``conf.py``
but you should never commit secrets such as this.


Extension options (``conf.py``)
-------------------------------

- ``sphinx_github_changelog_token``: GitHub API token, if needed.

Two options are accepted for backwards compatibility, but are likely detected
automatically from the ``:github:`` parameter to the directive:

- ``sphinx_github_changelog_root_repo`` (optional): Root URL to the repository.
- ``sphinx_github_changelog_graphql_url`` (optional): URL to GraphQL API.

.. _directive:

Directive
---------

.. code-block:: restructuredtext

    .. changelog::
        :changelog-url: https://your-project.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html
        :github: https://github.com/you/your-project/releases/
        :pypi: https://pypi.org/project/your-project/

Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~

- ``github`` (optional): URL to the releases page of the repository.
  If not provided, autoâ€‘detected from your git remote, as described above.
- ``changelog-url`` (optional): URL to the built version of your changelog.
  ``sphinx-github-changelog`` will display a link to your built changelog if the GitHub
  token is not provided (hopefully, this does not happen in your built documentation)
- ``pypi`` (optional): URL to the PyPI page of the repository. This allows the changelog
  to display links to each PyPI release.

You'll notice that each parameter here is not requested in the simplest form but as
very specific URLs from which the program extracts the needed information. This is
done on purpose. If people browse the unbuilt version of your documentation
(e.g. on GitHub or PyPI directly), they'll still be presented with links to the pages
that contain the information they will need, instead of unhelping directives.

.. Below this line is content specific to GitHub / PyPI that will not appear in the
   built doc.
